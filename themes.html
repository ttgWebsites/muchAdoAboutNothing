					<li data-theme="b">The Importance of Maintaining One's Honor</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Near the end of the novel when Claudio is tricked into leaving Hero on the altar this theme is seen quite clearly</li>
<li data-theme="c">Claudio believes that Hero is cheating on him, which at the time a woman's virginity is of supreme importance to keeping her honor</li>
<li data-theme="d">This causes Claudio to leave her at the altar, and the loss of Hero's honor plagues her whole family, who seemingly want to disown her</li>
<li data-theme="c">A mans honor is also very important, yet is maintained in a different way then a woman's honor</li>
<li data-theme="d">A mans honor was dependent on the bonds of friendship and alliances he made</li>
<li data-theme="c">And unlike a woman who's honor was disgraced and could not be prepared, a man could defend his honor by dueling</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">Deception</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Throughout the play many acts of deception are seen, some resulting in good outcomes and others not so much</li>
<li data-theme="c">Benedick and Beatrice at first seem to despise one another, however both are tricked into thinking the other is in love with them</li>
<li data-theme="d">This trick causes the two to actually fall in love and results in a successful and unexpected marriage</li>
<li data-theme="c">On the other hand Claudio is tricked into believing his soon to be wife is unfaithful</li>
<li data-theme="d">He becomes very upset and vows to destroy her reputation</li>
<li data-theme="c">Some are aware of Claudio's mistaken beliefs and know that Hero is innocent, Hero's death is faked in order to test Claudio's love after he discovers that she was in fact faithful to him</li>
<li data-theme="d">Claudio is distraught and vows to marry her cousin in turn</li>
<li data-theme="c">Claudio is really deceived and takes a disguised Hero's hand in marriage</li>
<li data-theme="d">Deception nearly ends the union between Claudio and Hero, and also helps fix the union</li>
				</ul>
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">The Ideal of Being Socially Graceful</li>
					<li data-theme="d">During the time period of the play much emphasis was put on courtiers to be very graceful and elegant in their actions and words</li>
<li data-theme="c">The characters in the play seem to emphasize this gracefulness and their banter is to an extent quite ridiculous</li>
<li data-theme="d">It seems as if Shakespeare is poking fun at the time periods belief about how one should act in society, as the characters seem a little outlandish</li>
<li data-theme="c">The emphasis put on social grace seems to cause issues, as one would not want to fall out of grace, even if it goes against what they believe is right</li>
<li data-theme="d">For example, Claudio allows Don John to woo Hero for him, however he believes that Don John actually woos Hero for himself</li>
<li data-theme="c">Claudio is upset by this but does not want to fall out of favor with Don John, and therefore does not confront him</li>
<li data-theme="d">In the end Claudio manages to wed Hero, but this example shows the ridiculousness of some efforts to maintain social grace</li>
