					<li data-theme="b">What does the play suggest about a men and women's relationships during the time period it was set?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">The character Beatrice is an extremely strong and self-sufficient woman throughout the play. Perhaps even the most admired heroine in any of Shakespeare's plays.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Despite her strength as a woman, and her regular denial of the need of a man during the play, in the end she falls in love with Benedick and marries.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Their relationship goes to show despite how strong an individual one may be, human connection and a relationship is far overpowering.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">However with the character Hero, we see a different relationship between men and women.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">When Hero's faithfulness is put into question her potential husband is quick to call her on it without foolproof evidence.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Claudio, as well has Hero's male relatives are also quick to call on their judgment openly and ridicule her in public.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Her father even proposes to let her die due to his embarrassment.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">How Hero is treated goes to show at the time being, women are still beneath men.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<ul data-role="listview" data-inset="true">
					<li data-theme="b">What seems to make Claudio and Hero's love seem fake and unnatural?</li>
					<li data-theme="d">Claudio and Hero seem to fall in love very quickly and plan a marriage after barely knowing each other.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">They have hardly a chance to spend time together before professing their love for one another, and it seems that their decision is made more so by youthful lust than actual love.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">However during Shakespeare's time it was quite common for relationships to develop from brief encounters, and even Claudio's act of having others court Hero for him was commonly practiced.</li>
					<li data-theme="c">Claudio's quick rejection of Hero after being tricked into believing she was unfaithful also seems to hint at a real lack of connection between the two as he does not do much investigating into the matter instead he embarrasses her and tarnishes her name in front of her family and friends.</li>
					<li data-theme="d">In the end however they manage to get married and forget the embarrassing events, and though this would suggest they are really in love, it is hard to truly believe after Claudio's quick rejection of her and their short lived courtship.</li>
